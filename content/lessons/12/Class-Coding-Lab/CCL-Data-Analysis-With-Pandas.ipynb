The RMS Titanic is one of the most famous ocean liners in history. On April 15, 1912 it sank after colliding with an iceberg in the North Atlantic Ocean. To learn more, read here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Titanic \n\nOur goal today is to perform a data analysis on a subset of the passenger list. We're looking for insights as to which types of passengers did and didn't survive. Women? Children? 1st Class Passengers? 3rd class? Etc. \n\nI'm sure you've heard the expression often said during emergencies: \"Women and Children first\" Let's explore this data set and find out if that's true!\n\nBefore we begin you should read up on what each of the columns mean in the data dictionary. You can find this information on this page: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data \n\n\n## Loading the data set\n\nFirst we load the dataset into a Pandas `DataFrame` variable. The `sample(10)` method takes a random sample of 10 passengers from the data set."

Recall a pandas dataframe is just a dictionary of series. We have two keys 'AllPassengers' and 'Survivors'\n- The  fourth line creates a new column in the dataframe which is just the survivors / all passengers to get the rate of survival for that Sex.\n\n## Feature Engineering: Adults and Children\n\nSometimes the variable we want to analyze is not readily available, but can be created from existing data. This is commonly referred to as **feature engineering**. The name comes from machine learning where we use data called *features* to predict an outcome. \n\nLet's create a new feature called `'AgeCat'` as follows:\n\n- When **Age** <=18 then 'Child'\n- When **Age** >18 then 'Adult'\n\nThis is easy to do in pandas. First we create the column and set all values to `np.nan` which means 'Not a number'. This is Pandas way of saying no value. Then we set the values based on the rules we set for the feature."
