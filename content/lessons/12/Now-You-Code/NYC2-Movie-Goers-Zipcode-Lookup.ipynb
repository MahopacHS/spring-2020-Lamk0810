They would like to know which **US State** each of the respondents in their movie goers survey comes from, and ask you to produce a list of states and a count of movie goers from that state.\n\nThe movie goers dataset `'NYC1-moviegoers.csv'` from NYC1 contains `'zip_code'` but not city and state.\n\nWe will load another pandas dataset, **the Zipcode Database** here: \n`'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mafudge/datasets/master/zipcodes/free-zipcode-database-Primary.csv'` This data set contains Zip codes with primary city, state and approximate location.\n\nYour goal is to figure out how to use the `DataFrame.merge()` method to combine these two data sets on matching zip code values.\nhttp://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.merge.html \n\nAfter you merge the dataset, then you can complete the task and provide a count of movie goers by state.\n"

This should be a personal narrative, in your own voice, and cite specifics relevant to the activity as to help the grader understand how you arrived at the code you submitted. Things to consider touching upon: Elaborate on the process itself. Did your original problem analysis work as designed?  How many iterations did you go through before you arrived at the solution? Where did you struggle along the way and how did you overcome it? What did you learn from completing the assignment? What do you need to work on to get better? What was most valuable and least valuable about this exercise? Do you have any suggestions for improvements?\n\nTo make a good reflection, you should journal your thoughts, questions and comments while you complete the exercise.\n\nKeep your response to between 100 and 250 words.\n\n`--== Write Your Reflection Below Here ==--`\n\n"
