Please use the Python geocoder module for this: https://geocoder.readthedocs.io/ \n\nOne you gave coordinates use the DarkSky api to get the 7 day forecast (it's the current conditions + 7 days out == 8 days total) for the location.\n\nExtract the forecast data and load it into Pandas, then display the Time of the forecast, and high and low temperatures:\n\n**HINT**: To get the times to show up in a human-readable format, you must convert the DarkSky API time (which is in unix timestamp format) to a Pandas Timestamp date/time format. The `pd.to_datetime()` function can help you:\n\n```\ntime = 1489402800 # this the time format Darksky returns\nreadable_time = pd.to_datetime(time, unit='s') ## s stands for unix timestamp format\nreadable_time\n\nTimestamp('2017-03-13 11:00:00')\n```\n\nJust replace the `['time']` column in the `DataFrame` with the new version."
