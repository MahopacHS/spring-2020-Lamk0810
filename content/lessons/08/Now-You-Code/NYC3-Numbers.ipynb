You will then demonstrate it's a list of\nnumbers by calculating the count, sum(), min(), max() and average\nof the numbers using Python's len(), sum(), min(), and max() functions.\n\nExample Run #1:\n```\n    Enter numbers separated by a space: 10 5 0\n\n    Numbers: [10.0, 5.0, 0.0]\n    Count: 3\n    Min: 0.0\n    Max: 10.0\n    Sum: 15.0\n    Average: 5.0\n```\n\nAs usual, devise your plan, write the program, THEN figure out how to handle bad input in Example run #2.\n\nHINT: Use split() to make a list from the input, use a loop to convert\neach item in the list to a float\n\nStart out your program by writing your TODO list of steps\nyou'll need to solve the problem!"

This should be a personal narrative, in your own voice, and cite specifics relevant to the activity as to help the grader understand how you arrived at the code you submitted. Things to consider touching upon: Elaborate on the process itself. Did your original problem analysis work as designed?  How many iterations did you go through before you arrived at the solution? Where did you struggle along the way and how did you overcome it? What did you learn from completing the assignment? What do you need to work on to get better? What was most valuable and least valuable about this exercise? Do you have any suggestions for improvements?\n\nTo make a good reflection, you should journal your thoughts, questions and comments while you complete the exercise.\n\nKeep your response to between 100 and 250 words.\n\n`--== Write Your Reflection Below Here ==--`\n\n"
