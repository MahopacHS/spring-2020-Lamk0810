What happens when you enter `TWO` instead of `2` for the number of people dining? or $60 as the amount of the check, instead of 60?\n\nAnswer: You get a Value Error  \n\n\n2. What type of error is this? Do you think it can be handled in code?\n\nAnswer:   Value error, TWO is a string not a number\n\n\n3. Explain what happens when you enter `0.5` for the number of people dining? Does the program run? Does it make sense? \n\nAnswer: The program doesn't run it gives you a value error. It makes sense because 1/2 a person isn't a number.   \n\n\n"

This should be a personal narrative, in your own voice, and cite specifics relevant to the activity as to help the grader understand how you arrived at the code you submitted. Things to consider touching upon: Elaborate on the process itself. Did your original problem analysis work as designed?  How many iterations did you go through before you arrived at the solution? Where did you struggle along the way and how did you overcome it? What did you learn from completing the assignment? What do you need to work on to get better? What was most valuable and least valuable about this exercise? Do you have any suggestions for improvements?\n\nTo make a good reflection, you should journal your thoughts, questions and comments while you complete the exercise.\n\nKeep your response to between 100 and 250 words.\n\n`--== Write Your Reflection Below Here ==--`\n\n"
